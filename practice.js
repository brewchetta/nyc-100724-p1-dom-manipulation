// // PAIR PROGRAMMING PRACTICE // //
// fork and clone this repo and follow the instructions in this file

// for all the instructions below work in this file, DO NOT amend the html to get your results, use DOM manipulation

// // DELIVERABLES // //

// 1. create a new div with an id of movie-posters and append it to the body

// 2. do this three times:

// 2.1 find a movie poster you like and add it as an <img> inside the movie-posters div

// 2.2 further refine the movie posters:
// change it so each movie poster is a <div> which has children for the poster <img>, the title <h2> and a short description <p>

// 4. console.log the title and description for the first movie poster

// 5. change the <img> src, title text, and description text for the second movie poster

// 6. delete the last movie poster



// // HINTS // //

// given that adding movie posters is a repetetive task, it may be easier to build
// a function that takes in certain arguments and does the work for you...

// remember that you need a few steps in order to finally see a dom element on the page:
// create the element
// change attributes like text or src
// append the element
